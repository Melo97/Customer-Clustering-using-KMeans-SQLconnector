# Customer-Clustering-using-KMeans-SQLconnector
This is and End-to-End Machine Learning Project for Customer Clusterization, encompassing many skills such as: 
 - **Database creation** (DDL) on mySQL IDE | **data convertion** from CSV to SQL format | building **Relationships** between tables;
 - **my SQL integration** with python (`mysql-connector`) | writting of **CRUD** queries inside jupyter notebook and convertion to pandas DataFrame;
 - Development of **ML algorithm** and **bussiness analysis** of results;
 
Our main goal here is to use KMeans clustering to define the customer importance, based on two main variables: the total *monetary spent (BRL)*, and *frequency of purchase by customer*. 

Take a look into the data **Schema**, from which we will build our DataFrame:
